# 📘 BrightLearn BigQuery Practical Exercise

## 🧠 Overview
This practical Excercise builds foundational and intermediate SQL skills using Google BigQuery.
It focuses on querying a retail sales dataset to extract insights, apply conditional logic, and perform aggregations—essential 
skills. 

## 📊 Dataset: Retail Sales Dataset
The dataset contains transactional data including:
- `Transaction_ID`
- `Customer_ID`, `Age`, `Gender`
- `Product_Category`, `Quantity`, `Price_per_Unit`, `Total_Amount`
- `Transaction_Date`

## 🧪 Exercise Breakdown

| # | Topic                      | Skill                                    | Output |
|---|-------                     |-------                                   |--------|
| 1 | `WHERE` Clause             | Filter by year                           | All columns |
| 2 | Filtering + Conditions     | Compare against average                  | All columns |
| 3 | Aggregate Functions        | Sum total revenue                        | `Total_Revenue` |
| 4 | `DISTINCT`                 | Unique categories                        | `Product_Category` |
| 5 | `GROUP BY`                 | Aggregate quantity by category           | `Product_Category`, `Total_Quantity` |
| 6 | `CASE` Statement           | Age classification                       | `Customer_ID`, `Age`, `Age_Group` |
| 7 | Conditional Aggregation    | Count high-value transactions by gender  | `Gender`, `High_Value_Transactions` |
| 8 | `HAVING` Clause            | Filter categories by revenue threshold   | `Product_Category`, `Total_Revenue` |
| 9 | Calculated Fields          | Categorize unit cost                     | `Transaction_ID`, `Price_per_Unit`, `Unit_Cost_Category` |
| 10 | Combined `WHERE` + `CASE` | Age filter + spending level              | `Customer_ID`, `Age`, `Total_Amount`, `Spending_Level` |

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise,  L learned to :
- Understand how to filter, group, and aggregate data in SQL
- Apply conditional logic using `CASE` statements
- Use calculated fields to derive new insights
- Combine multiple SQL clauses for advanced queries

## 🛠️ Tools Required
- Google BigQuery (or any SQL-compatible environment)
-  Retail Sales Dataset

## 📁 What I did
1. Loaded the dataset into BigQuery.
2. Execute each query as described in the exercise.
3. Validate outputs against expected results.
4. Reflect on how each SQL concept applies to real-world analytics.
